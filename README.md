# characterspace
Code for visualizing the character space of the British novel. 

This repository has scripts for extracting and visualizing what I'm calling the "character space" of late 18th- and 19th-century novels. I use the [Book NLP model](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp) model to extract and merge the context windows of characters.
